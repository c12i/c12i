I'm a software engineer with 6 years of experience building scalable backend systems using Rust, TypeScript, Python, and Go. I enjoy working on developer tools, performance-critical services, and privacy-first infrastructure.

I built **[Bunge Bits](https://github.com/c12i/bunge-bits)**, which processes Kenyan parliament proceedings into accessible summaries, and a few other projects you'll find pinned below.

I've given talks and led workshops on **[Programming WebAssembly in Rust](https://github.com/RustaceansKenya/Events/tree/master/14-December-2024)** (Rustaceans Kenya, 2024) and **[How to Speed Up Your Python with Rust](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aaWXNgludRwcvW8XDDbsECapudiSrvB_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109747351784674627857&rtpof=true&sd=true)** (PyCon Ke, 2022).
