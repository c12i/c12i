I'm a software engineer with 6 years of experience building scalable backend systems, primarily in Rust, TypeScript, Python, and Go. I enjoy working on developer tools, performance-critical services, and privacy-first infrastructure.

I built **[Bunge Bits](https://github.com/c12i/bunge-bits)**, which processes Kenyan parliament proceedings into accessible summaries, **[mpesa-rust](https://github.com/c12i/mpesa-rust)**, a Rust SDK for M-Pesa, and a few other projects you'll find pinned below.

I've given talks on **Programming WebAssembly in Rust** (Rustaceans Kenya, 2024) and **How to Speed Up Your Python with Rust** (PyCon Ke, 2022).

Outside of work, I train and compete in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, explore self-hosted tools, and tinker with side projects that bridge code and creativity.
